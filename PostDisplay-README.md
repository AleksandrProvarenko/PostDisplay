# PostDisplay
Application that downloads posts via API

- This project was completed as part of a test task.

- In this project, I had to load posts on the main screen using the API. When clicking on a post, 
 we go to the second screen, where detailed information about the post is loaded using another API by Id. 
 Text that spans more than two lines should be limited to two lines and display an expand button,
 and when the cell is expanded, display a collapse button. And a post that contains only 2 strings should not show the button at all. 
 Additionally, it was necessary to make local filtering by date and likes.

- FrameWorks: UIKit (programmatically)

- Stack I used in this project: Rest API, Grand Cental Dispach, MVVM, Autolayout.
